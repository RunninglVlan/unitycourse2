# Notes
## What's new
- [Debug Inspector Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InspectorOptions.html) lets you see private variables too (although their values can't be edited like those of public variables)
- Use Rigidbody's [AddRelativeForce](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce.html) to add a force relative to its coordinate system.
