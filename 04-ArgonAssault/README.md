# Notes
## What's new
- Terrain rendering takes a lot of power. To optimize performance, some [settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-OtherSettings.html) can be tweaked
  - Pixel Error - higher values indicate lower accuracy of the mapping between the terrain maps and the generated terrain but lower rendering overhead
  - Base Map Distance - Maximum distance at which terrain textures will be displayed at full resolution
  - Cast Shadows
- Another way to optimize performance during development is to turn off Auto Generation of lighting in Lighting Settings
- Terrain data is stored in binary form and can be shared between game objects (e.g. if scene will be duplicated, duplicate terrain will use the same binary ASSET). This binary data can be converted to text using Unity Tool binary2text.exe
- When Input is keyboard/mouse larger Sensitivity is responsible for faster response time, and larger Gravity - for faster time the input recenters.
- Script properties can have [Tooltips](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TooltipAttribute.html)
- Internally rotation is stored as Quaternion, so we need to use [Quaternion.Euler](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.Euler.html) to convert 3D XYZ rotation to 4D XYZW rotation.
- Order of rotation matters. Rotating by Y and then by X is not the same as rotating by X and then by Y, e.g. using `transform.Rotate`. In the latter example Z will also change, when rotating by Y after X.
- By holding down Ctrl and rotating objects using _Rotate Tool_ the values will be changed by certain amount, e.g. 0, 15, 30 degrees.
- Messages (AKA events) to other scripts on the object can be sent using [SendMessage](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SendMessage.html). This way you don't need script's reference in the caller.
- Game objects can be enabled/disabled through code using [SetActive](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SetActive.html)
- Active objects can be found using [FindObjectOfType](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.FindObjectOfType.html)
- Collisions with Particles can be handled using [OnParticleCollision](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnParticleCollision.html)
- Components can be added programmatically using [AddComponent](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.AddComponent.html)
