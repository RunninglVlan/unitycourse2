# Notes
## What's new
- Terrain rendering takes a lot of power. To optimize performance, some [settings](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/terrain-OtherSettings.html) can be tweaked
  - Pixel Error - higher values indicate lower accuracy of the mapping between the terrain maps and the generated terrain but lower rendering overhead
  - Base Map Distance - Maximum distance at which terrain textures will be displayed at full resolution
  - Cast Shadows
